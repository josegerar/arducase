    "overview": [
        "The Arduino Uno is a microcontroller board based on the ATmega328. ",
        "It has 14 digital input/output pins (of which 6 can be used as PWM outputs), ",
        "6 analog inputs, a 16 MHzceramic resonator, a USB connection, a power jack, ",
        "an ICSP header, and a reset button.  It contains everything needed to ",
        "support the microcontroller; simply connect it to a computer with a USB ",
        "cable or powerit with a AC-to-DC adapter or battery to get started."
