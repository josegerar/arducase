        " sending and receiving anything back when an object is in front of the sensor.",
        " Because using sound for its measurements we can reach up to 4 meters. The module ",
        "is about 45x20x15 mm in size and has a 4 pin connection. Two pins are needed to power ",
        "the module with 5 Volts. The working current is about 15 mA. One pin is the trigger ping ",
        "and the last one is used to read the result of the measurements, the echo pin. The measuring",
        " angle from the HC-SR04 is 15 degree. At 4 meter distance this should be a beam of about 1 meter.",
        " At 1 meter this is 26 cm so we have to keep this in mind when using this information."
